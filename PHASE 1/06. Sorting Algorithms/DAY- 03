3. Selection Sort :- 
👉we assume array into parts one is sorted and another one unsorted where Initially, we assume the entire array is unsorted and the sorted part is empty.so from unsorted part Finds the smallest number,
Fir us smallest element ko unsorted part ke first element ke sath swap kar dete hain Isse smallest element sorted part me chala jata hai Ye process tab tak repeat karte hain jab tak pura array sorted na ho jaye.
Example:
List: 4, 2, 1, 3
             Smallest is 1 → put it first → 1, 2, 4, 3
            Next smallest is 2 → already in place
            Next smallest is 3 → swap with 4
✅ Final: 1, 2, 3, 4
               ⚙️ Steps to Implement Selection Sort : 
                                              1️⃣ Start outer loop →
                                                        Run i from 0 to n-1 because if there will be remaining one element so by default that will be in it's position.
                                              2️⃣  assuming the first unsorted element is the smallest →
                                                        Set min = i,  Assume current index as minimum.
                                              3️⃣ Search for smaller element →
                                                        Run inner loop j from i+1 to n to find the actual smallest element’s index.
                                              4️⃣ Compare & Update minimum index →
                                                        If any arr[j] < arr[min], update min = j.
                                              5️⃣ after inner loop do Swaping →
                                                        After the inner loop, swap arr[i] with arr[min] if min != i.
                                              6️⃣ Repeat the process →
                                                        Continue until all elements are placed in their correct positions.
                                              7️⃣ Result →
                                                        Array becomes sorted in ascending order.

✅ Time Complexity = O(n2)
