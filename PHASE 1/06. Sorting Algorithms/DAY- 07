7. PigeonHole:
Pigeonhole Sort is a non-comparison based sorting algorithm used when the range of input values is small and known.
It works on the idea that each value belongs to a specific “pigeonhole”, and elements are placed into these holes based on their value.
Basic Idea (Pigeonhole Principle) :
     If you have n items and m pigeonholes, and each item belongs to one pigeonhole, then placing items into holes and collecting them in order results in a sorted sequence.
Example :
Input: [8, 3, 2, 7, 4, 6, 8]
Range:
   Minimum = 2
   Maximum = 8
Number of pigeonholes: max − min + 1 = 7
Steps:
    Put each element into its corresponding pigeonhole
    Collect elements from pigeonholes in order
Final Output: [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 8]
⚙️ Steps to Implement Pigeonhole Sort
    1️⃣ Find the minimum and maximum elements in the array.
                                       - This determines the range of values.
    2️⃣ Create pigeonholes (buckets) for each value in the range: 
                                       - size = max − min + 1
    3️⃣ Initialize each pigeonhole (usually as a list or count).
    4️⃣ Place each element into its pigeonhole:
                                       - index = value − min
    5️⃣ Collect elements from pigeonholes in increasing order of index.
    6️⃣ Store them back into the original array to get the sorted result.
Time Complexity: O(n + range)
where
n = number of elements
range = max − min + 1
Space Complexity:  O(range)
